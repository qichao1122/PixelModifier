# Image Viewer Project

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying, modifying, and saving pixel-based images.
The images are represented by pixel data that can be loaded from a text file, modified (e.g., grayscale or tinted), and saved back to a file.

There are 3 text files provided for testing the whole codes
